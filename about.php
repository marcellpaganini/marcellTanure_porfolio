                    <p>
                        Programming has always been a career I'd like pursue. The day I decided to make this huge switch from Brazil to Canada,
                        the opportunity to start a new career as a developer came along. Despite all the challenges faced as a newcomer, I
                        couldn't be happier with the choices made.

                        I'm looking forward to joining the workforce as an app developer as soon as I graduate.

                        From all my previous experiences, being an English teacher at language schools and learning new languages have always 
                        been a big passion. Therefore, as an independent project, I plan on matching app development with teaching methodologies 
                        by creating educational apps to help people learn new languages.
